### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Philipp. I'm currently in a webdev bootcamp to improve my skills and get a certificate.

I was in homeoffice even before corona started. In the last 5 years, I learned the hard way, how difficult it is to keep a sleeppattern in homeoffice. So how did my working hours change? At the end, it depends if there is a project I have to finish. In this case, I work when I'm up and sleep when I have time or my energy is at below zero. The next task is to get back to normal again.
